        <p>I want to talk about one of the regions called Svaneti, Svaneti is a high mountainous region, 
            <br>
            the majority of the population lives at the foot of the mountain, the specific weather of Svaneti is due to the wind and snow, the houses there are one or two-story houses,
            <br> 
            among which the Svan towers can be found. When the snow falls, the tower splits its sharp edges and thus protects the local villages,
            <br>
            In Svaneti, they used to follow me as a cattle herder because I couldn't dig in the mountains and I couldn't plant anything.</p>
